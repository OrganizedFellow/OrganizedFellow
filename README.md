I'm afraid there isn't really much to see here, but as I make progress on my projects, I will be sure to update this more often 😉

-   🔭 I’m currently working on mastering Nuxt! **The deeper I go, the deeper I go**.
-   -   I finished the [NuxtJS Fundamentals video](https://vueschool.io/courses/). It is a really well thought-out Intro to Nuxt! 👍
-   -   Also did [this tutorial from nuxtjs.org](https://nuxtjs.org/tutorials/creating-blog-with-nuxt-content/) where I created a simple Blog and styled it with TailwindCSS.
-   🌱 I am also currently enrolled in [The Web Developer Bootcamp 2021](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/). My completion rate is at _34%_.
-   💬 Ask me about ... coffee? I used to roast my own. And I have brewed several batched of beer!
-   ⚡ Fun facts: ...
-   -   I eat a bowl of Ramen most nights while coding.
-   -   I am a huge fan of Google and their old Nexus phones and their current Pixel line. Currently I have the Pixel 4a 5G. I've owned at least 8 of their devices.
-   -   My laptop is a Thinkpad E590 with 32GB RAM with a combined storage of 1.5TB on two SSDs.
-   -   I've used Linux far longer than I've used Windoze. Over 15 years ago I started on Suse, Mandrake, Ubuntu and later ventured into Arch, Manjaro, Crunchbang, a minumal Debian install with i3WM and now Pop OS 21.04. I've stopped distro-hopping after this current one.
