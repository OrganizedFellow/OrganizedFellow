- 🔭 I’m currently working on mastering Nuxt! **The deeper I go, the deeper I go**.
- - I finished the [NuxtJS Fundamentals video](https://vueschool.io/courses/). It is a really well thought-out Intro to Nuxt! 👍
- - Also did [this tutorial from nuxtjs.org](https://nuxtjs.org/tutorials/creating-blog-with-nuxt-content/) where I created a simple Blog and styled it with TailwindCSS.
- 🌱 I am also currently enrolled in [The Web Developer Bootcamp 2021](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/). My completion rate is at _~~34%~~_ _45%_.
- 💬 Ask me about ... ☕ coffee? I used to roast my own beans. 🍺 My favorite beers are IPA, stouts, and hefeweizens! Annnd I have two amazingly brilliant beautiful daughters 💑 .
- ⚡ Fun facts: ...
- - 🍜 I eat a bowl of Ramen most nights while coding.
- - 📱I am a huge fan of Google and their old Nexus phones and their current Pixel line. Currently I have the Pixel 4a 5G. I've owned at least 8 of their devices.
- - 💻 My laptop is a Thinkpad E590 with 32GB RAM with a combined storage of 1.5TB on two SSDs.
- - 🐧 I've used Linux far longer than I've used Windows. Over 15 years ago I started on Suse, Mandrake, Crunchbang and later ventured into Arch, Manjaro, a minimal Debian install with i3WM, every Ubuntu derivative and now Pop OS 21.04. I've stopped distro-hopping after this current one.
